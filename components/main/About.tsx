        <p>
          I found code through automating repetitive tasks as a real estate
          transaction coordinator in 2018, started learning the basics in 2020,
          and in mid 2021 left my job to learn full stack development full time.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Now I&apos;ve had the opportunity to lead development on a greenfield
          MVP for an international art competition, worked on multiple
          production CMS&apos;, and have coded extensively in an enterprise
          level code base.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">And I&apos;m ready for the next challenge.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
